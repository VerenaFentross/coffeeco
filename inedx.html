                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after
                    deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no catering
                    experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT to
                    look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the
                    customers were guests in my home.
                    </p>
                    <p>After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet
                    learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of being a
                    host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve to my
                    family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served
                    immediately to our guests.
                    </p>
